  - Log into the game and, if the email is registered on the [Gravatar] website (https://pt.gravatar.com/), have your photo associated with the user's profile.
  - Access the page referring to the game, where you must choose one of the answers available for each of the questions presented. The answer must be marked before the timer reaches zero, otherwise the answer will be considered wrong.
  - Be redirected, after 5 questions answered, to the score screen, where the text shown depends on the number of hits.
  - View the ranking page, if you like, at the end of each game.
  - Configure some options for the game in a configuration screen accessible from the app header.

- The application was developed in order to practice the concepts of _React_ and _Redux_.
